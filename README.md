# LED-GUI

This project started out as a way to understand how to create GUI in python using tkinter.

Projects in this Repository:
1. buttonLED.py
2. LED_GUI.py
3. RGB_GUI.py

buttonLED.py uses raspberry PIs GPIO pins to set up a button to turn on a LED

LED_GUI.py is the first GUI created, that is designed to toggle on and off and LED that is connected to the PIs GPIO pins. The GUI has three buttons, exit, on, and off.

RGB_GUI.py is a modified version of the first GUI that was created. It has three different colored LEDs connected to the raspberry PIs GPIO pins. The GUI has 4 buttons, RED, GREEN, BLUE, and EXIT. The three color buttons toggle on and off three different LEDs.

What's Next? Well the goal is to add to this program so it can store information the program gathers and stores the data in a MYSQL database. This will be done using python.
